This file contains the code for our project ... 

There are 3 activities 
    a) Permissions Activity : taking user permission for location
    b) MapsActivity : Displaying users current location on a map using google maps SDK
    c) LocationAdders Activity : this activity is not used .. has just created for name sake (Dont confuse yourselves)

Only thing left to do in this projet is Adding the actual 3rd Activity i.e Form Activity
